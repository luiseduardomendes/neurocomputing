## Introduction & Motivation

### What is the problem?

-    Explain gesture recognition and its challenges.

-    Why traditional models struggle with high-dimensional data.

### Why is this important?

-    Applications: Robotics, human-computer interaction, sign language interpretation.

### Objective of the Project

-    Develop an improved Kernel RCE Model that handles high-dimensional features.

## Dataset & Preprocessing

### Dataset Overview

-    Number of images, gesture classes (thumbs up/down, fist, etc.).

-    Examples of raw images (📸 add images here).

### Feature Extraction Process

-    Convert images to grayscale.

-    Apply Sobel edge detection and FFT transformation.

-    Generate final feature vectors (include a visualization of an extracted feature).

## The Model: Dimensionality-Safe Kernel RCE

### What is Kernel RCE?

-    A prototype-based classification method.

-    Uses learned prototypes instead of all data points.

### Key Improvements in Our Model

-    Dimensionality Reduction: Uses LDA for feature compression.

-    Adaptive Prototype Learning: Updates prototypes dynamically.

-    Radius-Based Classification: Adjusts decision boundaries based on similarity.

### 📌 Equation/Diagram:
